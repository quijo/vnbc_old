				VNBC is authorized and recognized as U level (undergraduate level) Nazarene institution by the International Board of Education (IBOE) Church of the Nazarene. 1962 was the year the vision to establish VNBC was partly realized and in 1964 a regular two-year Bible College was started. In January 1985 the VNBC Board of Directors decided to move the College from Iloilo City to Cebu City, since Cebu is in the center of the Visayan area. It was hoped that this movie would bring more students from Samar, leyte and Mindanao areas. It was also a move to expand the facilities of the College to handle 300 to 500 students. The move to Cebu from Iloilo took place in May 1986, and the College gained the highest students population of 92 in its first year in Cebu, a realization of the goal of expanding the college ministry in the Visayas-Mindanao field. The VNBC Pre-school, was established in June 1991, enabling the College to build a strong relationship with the surrounding community where most of the students live. The Pre-school serves as laboratory for RE College students majoring in Pre-school Education/Administration. The ministry was expanded with the opening of the elementary school in 2002 and in 2006 the secondary department was then realized.
