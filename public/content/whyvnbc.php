			<h3> Why VNBC?  </br>by: Shandra Gwyn B. Presbitero, Grade 10 - Issachar</h3>
            <p>Someone once asked me what parenthood is all about, and I just stared back at that person for a whole minute because seriously, what can a sixteen year old say to that? Days passed and I found myself mulling over that question over and over again. Months later, I finally have my answer:</br></br></br>
<i>           
“Parenthood is helping your child find his/her wings, teaching him/her how to fly, and being teary eyed when your little one’s finally flapping his/her wings and flying straight to the big world.”</i></br></br></br>
	But you can’t do all of these alone. It is essential to find an institution that would help your child grow and that would provide an environment that develops him/her into the mighty and beautiful individual that he/she is. 
</p>
            
            <p>  “VNBC believes in the importance of children. We won’t just dump information in their minds but help them to grow emotionally, physically, mentally and most importantly, spiritually”, said Rev. Stephen Gualberto, the VNBC (Interim) President, last June 8, 2016 during the Parent’s Orientation for the school year 2016-2017. Visayan Nazarene Bible College has been a home to many and the essence of family all around the campus is something one couldn’t deny. Here, teachers don’t simply teach children, they interweave their lives with theirs; they help them unleash their potentials and guide them with each step of their learning process. It is an environment that nurtures children to be better in life; the school where eaglets learn how to fly. </p>
            
            <p>For 52 years, the Visayan Nazarene Bible College served as a school that not only teaches but also touches lives. It has seen better days but greater years are fast approaching. Here, students are encouraged to bloom and to grow, nourished to become sturdy trees and mighty winds. It isn’t just an educational institution but also a hospital for the hurt, a shelter for the lost, a training ground for warriors, and a humble abode of students who stand out from the world.</p>
            
            <p>Three weeks into the school year 2016-2017, new breakthroughs are achieved by the school. New set of faculty and staff were introduced last Parent’s Orientation, namely:</p>

<p>VNBC, with its work force, aims to work alongside with the students to help them achieve their God-given potentials. Visayan Nazarene Bible College seeks to give assistance to the students whenever possible and guide them towards the direction God is willing them to take. </p>

<p>Jesus Christ being the center of this body, the Visayan Nazarene Bible College leads excellence through Christian education. They offer different learning avenues for students to discover and utilize their gifts; programs like ZION Music in which students can unleash their musical abilities and organizations like Pupil Student Supreme Government (PSSG) and Boys and Girls Brigade (BGB) where one can develop his/her leadership skills. Clubs like Campus Journalism, Math Whiz, Sports and Performing Arts are also available for students to explore. </p>

<p>Studying in this institution for more than a decade opened my eyes and allowed me to see the world in a different light. Not the usual black, white and gray; neither the optimist nor pessimist point of view. Being in this institution shone a neon light in the neutral aspect of life and made me see the jewel amidst the normalcy, that despite the ugliness the media is portraying in the news, there are still a whole lot of good people out there; that the world isn’t as bad as people think it is. That change starts within us and you always have the choice to do the right thing. That wrong is wrong even if everybody is doing it and right is right even if no one does. It helped be unleash my potentials and taught me how to use them for God.  VNBC has moulded me into the person I am right now, a strong and mighty girl who’s ready to take on the world for Jesus Christ. This Christian education institution has watched eagles fly and soar; and it was there when eaglets fell the first time they flew.</p>

<p> I believe education is a partnership between parents/guardians and the school, and VNBC is an exceptional partner. I and hundreds of other individuals found our wings in this school and maybe you can too! 

Together, let’s soar higher for Christ.
